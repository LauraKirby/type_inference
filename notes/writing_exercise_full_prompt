Imagine that your job is to help a programmer who is new to Swift learn about some of Swift’s fundamental features.

Your assignment: Write a short document that explains Swift’s type-inference system and why developers should care.

Assume that the audience of your document is made up of developers who have written apps for iOS or other platforms using Objective-C or another language, but who are unfamiliar with Swift.

Other info:

Media: You can’t use video, but you can use graphics (diagrams, illustrations, or screenshots). You don’t need to provide actual graphics; you can include text notes describing the graphic. You are also free to use a Swift playground as you see fit (though certainly not required).
Use a conversational, friendly tone (but also one consonant with conceptual documentation on developer.apple.com)
While you have 3–4 days to submit the test, spend no more than 3 hours to actually take the test. If you spend significantly more or less time, please indicate that.
Please let us know as soon as possible if you need any assistance in completing the test under the described conditions.
Do not use any copyrighted material as part of your test submission.

There’s no one “right” way to complete this assignment. We’re interested in how you think about the content. If you like, you can provide some meta information describing your process or why you made the choices you made.
